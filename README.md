# Project 1: Analysis of current Laliga players and create a team of Top players for each position 

## Problem statement
We want to analyze teams and players for different positions, starting from Goalkeepers, all
the way to strikers and create a fantasy team that has the best players for each position.

are missing values and mixed data types that need to be addressed properly
