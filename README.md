# Project 1: Analyse current Laliga players to create a team of Top players for each position 

## Problem statement
We want to analyze teams and players for different positions, starting from Goalkeepers, all
the way to strikers and create a fantasy team that has the best players for each position.
This Fantasy team should beat all the regular teams in the league.

are missing values and mixed data types that need to be addressed properly
